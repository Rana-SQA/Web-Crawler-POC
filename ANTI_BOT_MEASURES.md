# Anti-Bot Detection Measures for OTA Scraping

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive anti-bot detection measures implemented in the hotel price scraper to avoid detection by Online Travel Agency (OTA) websites.

## üõ°Ô∏è Implemented Anti-Bot Measures

### 1. **Dynamic User Agent Rotation**

- Rotates between realistic user agents for different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Includes both Windows and macOS variants
- Uses current browser versions to avoid outdated signatures

### 2. **Viewport Randomization**

- Random but realistic screen resolutions
- Includes popular laptop and desktop dimensions
- Matches common device configurations

### 3. **Enhanced Browser Arguments**

- Comprehensive set of Chrome flags to disable automation detection
- Memory and performance optimizations
- Audio/video policies to simulate real users
- Language and locale settings
- Graphics and network behavior modifications

### 4. **JavaScript Stealth Injection**

- Overrides `navigator.webdriver` property
- Spoofs browser plugins and chrome properties
- Removes automation indicators
- Implements realistic mouse movements
- Adds random scrolling behavior
- Simulates human reading patterns

### 5. **Human-Like Timing**

- Randomized delays between requests (2-8 seconds base)
- Occasional longer delays (10% chance for 5-15 seconds)
- Micro-delays to simulate thinking behavior
- Realistic scrolling and interaction timing

### 6. **Session Management**

- Tracks session usage with rotation limits
- Rotates sessions after 20 requests or 30 minutes
- Maintains consistency within sessions
- Prevents patterns that indicate automation

### 7. **Realistic HTTP Headers**

- Complete set of browser headers
- Appropriate accept headers for content types
- Cache control and security headers
- DNT (Do Not Track) and other privacy headers

### 8. **Enhanced Page Interaction**

- Waits for network idle instead of just page load
- Simulates human reading with gradual scrolling
- Mouse hover events over room elements
- Natural progression through page content

### 9. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**

- Automatic session rotation on failures
- Longer delays before retries
- Different stealth parameters for retry attempts

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Browser Configuration

```python
browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    browser_type="undetected",
    headless=random.choice([False, False, True]),  # Mostly visible
    user_agent=session_manager.user_agent,
    viewport_width=session_manager.viewport["width"],
    viewport_height=session_manager.viewport["height"],
    extra_args=get_enhanced_browser_args(),
    headers=get_realistic_headers()
)
```

### Session Rotation Logic

- **Time-based**: Sessions rotate every 30 minutes
- **Request-based**: Sessions rotate after 20 requests
- **Failure-based**: Immediate rotation on detection

### Human-Like Delays

- **Base delay**: 2-8 seconds between requests
- **Extended delays**: 5-15 seconds (10% of requests)
- **Micro-delays**: 0.1-0.8 seconds for thinking simulation

## üìä Detection Avoidance Strategies

### 1. **Behavioral Patterns**

- Varied request timing to avoid regular intervals
- Mixed browser visibility (mostly non-headless)
- Natural scrolling and interaction patterns
- Realistic mouse movement simulation

### 2. **Technical Fingerprinting**

- Disabled automation indicators
- Spoofed browser properties
- Realistic plugin and permission APIs
- Dynamic viewport and user agent combinations

### 3. **Network Patterns**

- Appropriate HTTP headers for each request
- Realistic cache and security headers
- Proper language and encoding preferences

## üö® Usage Recommendations

### Production Deployment

1. **Monitor Detection**: Watch for blocked requests or unusual responses
2. **Adjust Timing**: Increase delays if detection increases
3. **Rotate Proxies**: Consider proxy rotation for high-volume scraping
4. **Limit Concurrent**: Avoid multiple simultaneous sessions

### Performance Tuning

- Balance stealth vs. speed based on detection rates
- Monitor session rotation frequency
- Adjust delay ranges based on target site behavior

### Compliance Considerations

- Respect robots.txt when possible
- Implement rate limiting appropriate for site capacity
- Consider ToS implications of data collection

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Success Metrics

- Low rate of failed requests
- Consistent data extraction success
- No increase in CAPTCHAs or blocks

### Warning Signs

- Sudden increase in timeouts
- CAPTCHA challenges appearing
- Consistent extraction failures
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses

### Maintenance Tasks

- Update user agent strings quarterly
- Review and update browser arguments
- Monitor target site changes
- Adjust timing parameters based on success rates

**Note**: These measures are designed to be respectful of target websites while enabling legitimate data collection. Always ensure compliance with applicable terms of service and local regulations.
